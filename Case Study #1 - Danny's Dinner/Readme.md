## Question and Solution

Please executing the queries using Microsoft SQL SERVER MANAGMENT SYSTEM.

If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niteshadwani/).

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
select s.customer_id,sum(m.price) from sales s
join menu m on s.product_id = m.product_id
group by customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `sales` and `menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
select customer_id,COUNT(distinct order_date) from sales 
group by customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- To determine the unique number of visits for each customer, utilize **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)**.
- It's important to apply the **DISTINCT** keyword while calculating the visit count to avoid duplicate counting of days. For instance, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021‚Äì01‚Äì07', counting without **DISTINCT** would result in 2 days instead of the accurate count of 1 day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
with cte as 
(select s.customer_id,m.product_name,DENSE_RANK() over (partition by customer_id order by s.order_date) as rnk 
from sales s
JOIN menu m on s.product_id = m.product_id)
 select customer_id,product_name from cte where rnk =1
 group by customer_id,product_name;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `cte`. Within the CTE, create a new column `rnk` and calculate the row number using **DENSE_RANK()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `customer_id`, and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each partition by `order_date`.
- In the outer query, select the appropriate columns and apply a filter in the **WHERE** clause to retrieve only the rows where the rank column equals 1, which represents the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Use the GROUP BY clause to group the result by `customer_id` and `product_name`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.

***

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
select m.product_name,count(s.product_id) as most_purchsed from menu m 
join sales s on m.product_id = s.product_id
group by product_name
order by most_purchsed desc;
````

#### Steps:
- Perform a **COUNT** aggregation on the `product_id` column and **ORDER BY** the result in descending order using `most_purchased` field.

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |


- Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times. Yummy!

***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
with cte as 
(select s.customer_id,m.product_name,
DENSE_RANK() over (partition by s.customer_id order by count(s.product_id) desc) as rnk
from sales s
join menu m on s.product_id = m.product_id
group by s.customer_id,m.product_name)
select customer_id,product_name from cte where rnk =1;
````

*Each user may have more than 1 favourite item.*

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE named `cte` and within the CTE, join the `menu` table and `sales` table using the `product_id` column.
- Group results by `sales.customer_id` and `menu.product_name` and calculate the count of `menu.product_id` occurrences for each group. 
- Utilize the **DENSE_RANK()** window function to calculate the ranking of each `sales.customer_id` partition based on the count of orders **COUNT(`sales.customer_id`)** in descending order.
- In the outer query, select the appropriate columns and apply a filter in the **WHERE** clause to retrieve only the rows where the rank column equals 1, representing the rows with the highest order count for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu. He/she is a true foodie, sounds like me.

***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql

with cte as 
(select mem.customer_id,s.product_id,ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by mem.customer_id order by s.order_date) as rnk
from members mem
join sales s on mem.customer_id = s.customer_id
where s.order_date > mem.join_date)

select customer_id,product_name from cte
join menu m on cte.product_id = m.product_id
where rnk =1;
```

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE named `CTE` and within the CTE, select the appropriate columns and calculate the row number using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `members.customer_id` and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each `members.customer_id` partition by `sales.order_date`.
- Join tables `members` and `sales` on `customer_id` column. Additionally, apply a condition to only include sales that occurred *after* the member's `join_date` (`sales.order_date > members.join_date`).
- In the outer query, join the `cte` CTE with the `menu` on the `product_id` column.
- In the **WHERE** clause, filter to retrieve only the rows where the row_num column equals 1, representing the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Order result by `customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order as a member is ramen.
- Customer B's first order as a member is sushi.

***

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql

with cte as
(select mem.customer_id,s.product_id,row_number() over(partition by mem.customer_id order by s.order_date desc) as rnk
from members mem join sales s on mem.customer_id = s.customer_id
where s.order_date < mem.join_date)
select customer_id,product_name from cte
join menu m on cte.product_id = m.product_id
where rnk =1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `cte`. 
- In the CTE, select the appropriate columns and calculate the rank using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The rank is determined based on the order dates of the sales in descending order within each customer's group.
- Join `members` table with `sales` table based on the `customer_id` column, only including sales that occurred *before* the customer joined as a member (`sales.order_date < members.join_date`).
- Join `cte` CTE with `.menu` table based on `product_id` column.
- Filter the result set to include only the rows where the rank is 1, representing the earliest purchase made by each customer before they became a member.
- Sort the result by `customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Both customers' last order before becoming members are sushi.

***

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
select s.customer_id,count(distinct	s.product_id) as product_count,sum(m.price) as total_spent from sales s
join menu m on s.product_id = m.product_id
join members mem on s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
where s.order_date < mem.join_date
group by s.customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
- Select the columns `sales.customer_id` and calculate the count of `sales.product_id` as total_items for each customer and the sum of `menu.price` as total_sales.
- From `sales` table, join `members` table on `customer_id` column, ensuring that `sales.order_date` is earlier than `members.join_date` (`sales.order_date < members.join_date`).
- Then, join `menu` table to `sales` table on `product_id` column.
- Group the results by `sales.customer_id`.
- Order the result by `sales.customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 3 items.

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier ‚Äî how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
with cte as 
(select m.product_id,
case when product_id = 1 then price * 20
else price * 10 end as points 
from menu m)
select s.customer_id,sum(cte.points) as tota_points
from sales s join cte on cte.product_id = s.product_id
group by s.customer_id;

```

#### Steps:
Let's break down the question to understand the point calculation for each customer's purchases.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points. However, `product_id` 1 sushi gets 2x points, so each $1 spent = 20 points.
- Here's how the calculation is performed using a conditional CASE statement:
	- If product_id = 1, multiply every $1 by 20 points.
	- Otherwise, multiply $1 by 10 points.
- Then, calculate the total points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is $860.
- Total points for Customer B is $940.
- Total points for Customer C is $360.

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi ‚Äî how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
with dates_cte as 
(SELECT 
    customer_id, join_date, DATEADD(DAY, 6, join_date) AS valid_date,
    '2021-01-31' AS last_date
FROM members)

SELECT 
  s.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
    WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
    ELSE 10 * m.price END) AS points
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON s.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND dates.join_date <= s.order_date
  AND s.order_date <= dates.last_date
INNER JOIN menu m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```

#### Assumptions:
- On Day -X to Day 1 (the day a customer becomes a member), each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, for sushi, each $1 spent earns 20 points.
- From Day 1 to Day 7 (the first week of membership), each $1 spent for any items earns 20 points.
- From Day 8 to the last day of January 2021, each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, sushi continues to earn double the points at 20 points per $1 spent.

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `dates_cte`. 
- In `dates_cte`, calculate the `valid_date` by adding 6 days to the `join_date` and determine the `last_date` of the month by subtracting 1 day from the last day of January 2021.
- From `sales` table, join `dates_cte` on `customer_id` column, ensuring that the `order_date` of the sale is after the `join_date` (`dates.join_date <= sales.order_date`) and not later than the `last_date` (`sales.order_date <= dates.last_date`).
- Then, join `menu` table based on the `product_id` column.
- In the outer query, calculate the points by using a `CASE` statement to determine the points based on our assumptions above. 
    - If the `product_name` is 'sushi', multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. For orders placed between `join_date` and `valid_date`, also multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. 
    - For all other products, multiply the price by 10.
- Calculate the sum of points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1020 |
| B           | 320 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,020.
- Total points for Customer B is 320.
